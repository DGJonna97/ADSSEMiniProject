# ADSSE mini project
This is my github repository containing the scripts used in my report about hashing.

The repository contains two python files. The main.py is used to execute the hash functions, where it is possible to choose between the division method, multiplication method and universal method.
It is also possible to choose the collision type, and the probe type if open addressing is chosen to handle collisions.
